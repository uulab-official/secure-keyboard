# Native platform integration

The first Secure Native renderers are under `native/ios` and
`native/android`. They share `crates/secure-ffi/include/secure_keypad.h` and
never use a text input widget for the secret. The repository pins Rust
1.97.1 and the device/simulator targets in `rust-toolchain.toml`.

## iOS

`native/ios/SecureKeypadView.swift` is a UIKit view that accepts public layout
and theme values, sends key IDs to the Rust C ABI, and renders only bullets and
non-secret state. It masks presentation while the app is inactive or the
screen is captured. The submission callback is native-only.

Local typecheck:

```sh
IOS_SDK=$(xcrun --sdk iphoneos --show-sdk-path)
swiftc -warnings-as-errors -typecheck \
  -sdk "$IOS_SDK" \
  -target arm64-apple-ios26.0 \
  -I native/ios/SecureKeypadFFI \
  native/ios/SecureKeypadView.swift
```

An application target must link the Rust `secure-ffi` static library built for
the matching iOS device/simulator architectures and expose the same module
map. The library and Swift view must be built in the same release pipeline;
the Swift source alone is not a security boundary.

Reference Rust artifacts:

```sh
cargo build --release -p secure-ffi --target aarch64-apple-ios
cargo build --release -p secure-ffi --target aarch64-apple-ios-sim
```

## Android

`native/android/src/main/kotlin/.../SecureKeypadView.kt` is a custom
`FrameLayout` with public key/layout/theme models. The JNI adapter in
`native/android/src/main/cpp/secure_keypad_jni.c` owns only pointer handles and
calls the C ABI. The Activity window receives `FLAG_SECURE`, autofill is
excluded, and no `EditText` is created.

Local checks with the Android SDK installed:

```sh
ANDROID_JAR="$HOME/Library/Android/sdk/platforms/android-37.0/android.jar"
KOTLINC="/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/plugins/Kotlin/kotlinc/bin/kotlinc"
"$KOTLINC" native/android/src/main/kotlin/com/uulab/securekeypad/SecureKeypadView.kt \
  -classpath "$ANDROID_JAR" -jvm-target 17 -Werror -d /tmp/secure-keypad-android.jar
```

The application must link the JNI adapter with the Rust `secure-ffi` library
for every ABI it ships. The CMake file intentionally does not invent a Rust
library path; the host build must provide the architecture-specific artifact.

For an arm64 Android build, configure the NDK linker explicitly:

```sh
NDK="$HOME/Library/Android/sdk/ndk/27.1.12297006"
export CARGO_TARGET_AARCH64_LINUX_ANDROID_LINKER="$NDK/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/darwin-x86_64/bin/aarch64-linux-android24-clang"
cargo build --release -p secure-ffi --target aarch64-linux-android
```

## Framework adapters

React Native and Flutter adapters must wrap these native views as native
components/PlatformViews. They may pass layout, theme, locale, accessibility,
and masked state. They must not pass `SecureKeypadSubmission` handles or
transport bytes through JavaScript/Dart serialization. Expo Go and ordinary
Flutter hot-reload runtimes cannot host this security boundary without a
custom native build.
